# Predicting Cycling Performance Using Strava Cycling Data

This research delves into predicting cycling performance, specifically Functional Threshold Power (FTP), using comprehensive Strava activity data. Embracing a seven-year cycling journey, the study leverages heart rate monitors, power meters, and sensors to construct a nuanced dataset. Traditional FTP tests, often impeded by factors like overfatigue and mental stress, serve as benchmarks for improvement. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model circumventing the need for these tests, exploring alternative approaches based on Strava data. Research objectives encompass trend analysis in training zones, performance changes, FTP prediction, model defense, and causal relationship evaluation. A critical literature review highlights the research gap in FTP prediction using Strava data, setting the stage for this novel contribution.
